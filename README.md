This script is a easy to use announce script that can be used with badger's ace perms and discord perms

Announce command documentation

Thanks for downloading!

This script is useable for vMenu, ESX, QBCore and has no SQL files

In order to get the perms.cfg to work you must put them in your server files EX:(/g535073/gta5-fivem-txadmin/ZAP-HostingESXPack_B502AB.base) it needs to go where you would put your server.cfg

Put this in your server.cfg at the top before the line that you ensure the script (exec perms.cfg) just like that

If you have questions on how to do ace perms regarding groups please refer to the perms.cfg where it will explain how to add perms or ask on my github!
